Practice code for JS Unit testing course (JavaScript Unit Testing - The Practical Guide)


 https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-unit-testing-the-practical-guide/

### Focus

As part of this course, typical testing problems are defined and solved and common strategies like mocking or working with spies are taught in great detail. This course also does not focus on specific types of JavaScript projects - neither does it focus on any specific library or framework.

Instead, it focuses on how to automatically test your (vanilla) JavaScript code, no matter if it's a NodeJS or frontend project. The fundamentals gained from this course benefits all future projects - backend (NodeJS) and frontend (vanilla JS, React, Vue, Angular) alike.

### Topics covered in the course are:

- What exactly "testing" or "automated testing" is (and why you need it)
- What "unit testing" is specifically
- Which tools you need to enable automated unit tests in your projects
- How to write unit tests
- How to get started with integration tests
- How to formulate different expectations (assertions)
- Which patterns to follow when writing tests
- How to test asynchronous and synchronous code
- How to deal with side effects with help of spies & mocks
- How to apply all these concepts in real projects & examples
